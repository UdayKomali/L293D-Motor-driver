## Introduction
Here is the L293D motor driver, which performs all tasks performed by an IC. It is a 2-motor controlled double-layer PCB design of the L293D motor driver IC. 

Here I used Transistors and flysack diodes instead of motor driver ICS (like L298N, L293D, etc). For heat dissipation, there exists a copper pour near every transistor. It completes every task that is done by the L293D motor driver, and also there is no need for separate power supply to the motors as I used MP1584 step-down voltage regulator
